**Protocol overview: fixed certificate → append-only ledger → independent verifier (OK / NG).**

ghost-drift-audit is a certificate-based audit engine for drift detection in operational time-series forecasting (MLOps). It outputs a verifiable certificate + immutable ledger so any third party can reproduce the same OK/NG verdict from the same inputs—no post-hoc threshold tuning after results are observed.
Note: Bundled CSVs are dummy data for smoke tests. The published certificates and audit report correspond to the real Jan–Apr 2024 electricity demand × weather dataset.
Case study: electricity demand forecasting (power demand × weather, Jan–Apr 2024). This repo exports certificates, ledgers, and evidence time series as reproducible audit artifacts.

## Formal Verification

The core lemma of the ADIC framework has been formally verified using the Lean theorem prover.

## 💎 Design Philosophy: From "Probabilistic" to "Accountable"

To address the “opaque inference” problem in conventional AI operations, this framework provides the following.

> [!TIP]
> **Audit-First Design**
> Alongside running predictions, it automatically generates objectively verifiable **evidence** for third parties.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tamper-evident Fingerprints**
> It fixes hash fingerprints of input data and configuration parameters, making post-hoc modifications mathematically detectable.

> [!NOTE]
> **Verifiable Integrity**
> Rather than mere statistical optimality, it makes visible the model’s **faithful adherence** to operational rules.

## ⚙️ Execution Profiles

Switch the strictness of the audit via `AUDIT_CONFIG['PROFILE']`.

| Profile    | Use / Target                        | Strictness | Key Features                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------: | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| demo       | Smoke test / learning               |        Low | Prioritizes understanding behavior and evidence output |
| paper      | Research / reproducible experiments |        Mid | Ensures computational reproducibility via fixed seeds  |
| commercial | Production / decision-making        |       High | Produces strict gate checks and a final verdict        |

### How to Configure

```python
AUDIT_CONFIG = {
  "PROFILE": "demo",  # "demo" | "paper" | "commercial"
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage

### 1. Setup

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib lightgbm
```

### 2. Prepare Data

Place the CSV files in the same directory as the `.py`.

> [!CAUTION]
> The bundled CSVs are synthetic (dummy) data.
> They are for smoke testing only; for production use or research, use real data for which you hold the rights.

### 3. Run

```bash
python ghost_drift_audit_JP.py
```

### 4. Verification (adic_out/)

* 📜 **certificate.json:** a “certificate” of execution conditions and verdict summary
* 📑 **ledger.csv:** an immutable “ledger” that records the full history
* 📉 **evidence_timeseries.csv:** time-series evidence for re-verification

## ⚖️ Scope & Integrity (Non-claims)

### 🎯 Scope & Limits

* **Scope:** Make the model’s behavior and assumption failures observable, and fix an audit trail for intervention decisions.
* **Non-claims:** Does not guarantee zero future error, a mathematically “unique correct answer,” or generalization in extrapolation regimes.

### 🛡️ Threat Model (Tamper Detection)

* **Threshold manipulation:** Arbitrary changes to conceal anomalies → detected via Cap records
* **Baseline manipulation:** Post-hoc changes to comparison baselines → detected via config fingerprint mismatches
* **Data fabrication:** Input swapping or fabrication → verified against Data Fingerprints
